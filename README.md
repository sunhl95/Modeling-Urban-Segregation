# Modeling-Urban-Segregation
write a simulation program in C to experiment with Schelling’s model

You can change n1(row of matrix), n2(column of matrix) and f(fraction) in top of main function. Then press Run, you will get the results.

Result: The first and last matrixes are the initial matrix and the final outcome matrix separately. In each end of time step, you will see “result” which means the number of cells are moved in this time step.
